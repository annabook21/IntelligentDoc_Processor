# Honest Assessment of Current State

## What I Did Wrong

1. **Didn't properly research AWS Bedrock Flows patterns** before building
2. **Created unnecessary Lambda functions** (Agent creator, document processor wrapper)
3. **Used wrong invocation pattern** (Lambda → Agent → Flow instead of direct Flow invocation)
4. **Left broken references** (stack references deleted Lambda files)
5. **Flow definition uses incorrect node types** (ToolUse with non-existent tools)

## Current Broken State

- ❌ Stack references `agent-creator.js` - FILE DELETED
- ❌ Stack references `document-processor.js` - FILE DELETED  
- ❌ Stack tries to create Agent - NOT NEEDED for Flows
- ❌ Flow definition JSON has invalid node structure
- ❌ Using SQS → Lambda → Agent pattern (WRONG)
- ✅ Only `flow-creator.js` is correctly structured (infrastructure Lambda)

## What Needs to Happen

1. **Complete redesign** of the main stack
2. **Remove all Agent references**
3. **Set up EventBridge** to invoke Flow directly
4. **Fix Flow JSON definition** to match AWS samples pattern
5. **Create only necessary Lambda tools** (if Flow needs them for Textract/DynamoDB)
6. **Consolidate API handlers** into one function

## Correct Pattern (Based on AWS Samples)

```
S3 Event → EventBridge Rule → Bedrock Flow (bedrock-runtime:InvokeFlow)
                               ↓
                         Flow orchestrates:
                         - Prompt nodes (Claude)
                         - Lambda tool nodes (if needed)
                         - Output
```

**Lambda Functions Needed:**
- 1 Infrastructure: flow-creator (custom resource)
- 0-4 Tools: Only if Flow needs Textract/DynamoDB/OpenSearch wrappers
- 1 API: Consolidated handler for search/metadata

**Total: 2-6 Lambdas** (not 8+)
