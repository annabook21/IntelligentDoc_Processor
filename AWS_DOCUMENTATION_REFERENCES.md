# AWS Documentation References for Security & DR

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HONEST ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION

**You asked: "is that even a best practice?? What AWS documentations were referenced here?"**

**Answer**: I implemented security features based on general AWS knowledge but **did NOT verify all implementations against specific AWS documentation**. Some properties I used may be invalid or incorrect.

## Issues Corrected

1. ‚ùå **`FunctionEncryption.KMS`** - REMOVED (doesn't exist in CDK Lambda)
2. ‚ùå **`automatedSnapshotStartHour`** - REMOVED (not a CDK property)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No specific AWS documentation was referenced** - I should have referenced these:

## What I Actually Implemented (Verified)

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Valid Security Practices

1. **S3 Encryption with KMS** - ‚úÖ Valid
   - CDK: `s3.BucketEncryption.KMS`
   - Docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html

2. **DynamoDB Customer-Managed KMS** - ‚úÖ Valid
   - CDK: `dynamodb.TableEncryption.CUSTOMER_MANAGED`
   - Docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/encryption.how-it-works.html

3. **OpenSearch Encryption at Rest ‚ÑπÔ∏è KMS** - ‚úÖ Valid
   - CDK: `encryptionAtRest.kmsKeyId`
   - Docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/encryption.html

4. **OpenSearch Multi-AZ** - ‚úÖ Valid
   - CDK: `zoneAwareness.enabled: true`
   - Docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managedomains.html#managedomains-multiaz

5. **S3 Versioning** - ‚úÖ Valid
   - CDK: `versioned: true`
   - Docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html

6. **DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery** - ‚úÖ Valid
   - CDK: `pointInTimeRecovery: true`
   - Docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/PointInTimeRecovery.html

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Removed Invalid Implementations

1. **Lambda Function Encryption** - REMOVED
   - I used `FunctionEncryption.KMS` which doesn't exist
   - Correct approach: Lambda code is encrypted by AWS by default
   - Environment variables: Can be encrypted but requires separate configuration
   - Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-encryption

2. **OpenSearch Automated Snapshots** - REMOVED
   - I used `automatedSnapshotStartHour` which doesn't exist in CDK
   - Automated snapshots are enabled by default in OpenSearch
   - Configuration: Via OpenSearch API, not CDK properties
   - Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/automated-snapshots.html

### üîç Needs Further Verification

1. **API Gateway Throttling** - Likely correct but need to verify
2. **IAM Policy Scoping** - Need to verify all policies follow least privilege

## What Should Be Added for Production

1. **API Gateway Authentication** (mentioned as TODO)
   - IAM, Cognito, or API Keys
   - Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-control-access-using-iam-policies-to-invoke-api.html

2. **VPC Configuration for OpenSearch** (optional but recommended)
   - Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/vpc.html

3. **CloudTrail Logging** (mentioned but not configured)
   - Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html

4. **S3 Cross-Region Replication** (DR requirement)
   - Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html

5. **DynamoDB Global Tables** (DR requirement)
   - Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html

## Conclusion

**I apologize for implementing features without proper verification against AWS documentation.** I've now:
1. Removed invalid properties
2. Added comments pointing to correct AWS documentation
3. Created this reference document

The remaining implementations are valid AWS CDK patterns, but should still be reviewed against official AWS documentation before production deployment.
