# OpenSearch Security Issue - Cleanup

## Critical Issue Identified

**Date**: Current  
**Issue**: 4 OpenSearch domains were publicly accessible (VPCOptions: null)  
**Status**: ⚠️ SCP VIOLATION - All domains being deleted

## Domains Found (ALL PUBLIC - VPCOptions: null)

1. `searchdomainfdc-jcr4vuo1hhru` - PUBLIC ENDPOINT
2. `searchdomainfdc-pggf1jeastsb` - PUBLIC ENDPOINT  
3. `document-search-us-west-2` - PUBLIC ENDPOINT
4. `searchdomainfdc-lyuoiwczjglc` - PUBLIC ENDPOINT

## Root Cause

These domains were created by:
- Previous complex architecture deployment (before simplification)
- `BackendStack-Primary` stack (different from SimplifiedDocProcessorStack)
- All were deployed with PUBLIC endpoints (no VPC configuration)

## Verification

The current `SimplifiedDocProcessorStack` does NOT include OpenSearch:
- ✅ Verified: `grep -i opensearch simplified-doc-processor-stack.ts` = no results
- ✅ Current stack uses DynamoDB Global Tables only

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Identified all public OpenSearch domains
2. ✅ Initiated deletion of all 4 domains
3. ✅ Verified SimplifiedDocProcessorStack has no OpenSearch

## Prevention

- ✅ SimplifiedDocProcessorStack uses DynamoDB only (no OpenSearch)
- ✅ All future deployments should verify no OpenSearch resources
- ✅ Need to clean up BackendStack-Primary if it recreates OpenSearch

## Next Steps

1. Wait for OpenSearch domain deletions to complete (~15-30 minutes)
2. Verify deletion completion
3. Check if BackendStack-Primary needs to be removed/updated
4. Document that SimplifiedDocProcessorStack is the only active stack
