# OpenSearch VPC Configuration - Documentation References

## Honest Assessment

**I need to be transparent**: When I implemented the OpenSearch VPC configuration, I did NOT initially reference specific AWS CDK API documentation. I used:
1. General knowledge of CDK patterns
2. AWS service documentation about VPC deployment
3. Pattern matching from similar CDK constructs

However, **the CDK synthesis succeeds**, which indicates the properties are valid, but let me document what was actually referenced vs. what should be verified.

## What I Actually Referenced

### 1. AWS OpenSearch Service - VPC Deployment Guide
- **URL**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/vpc.html
- **Content**: General guidance on deploying OpenSearch domains in VPCs
- **Limitation**: This is service-level documentation, not CDK-specific

### 2. Well-Architected Framework Gaps Document
- **File**: `WELL_ARCHITECTED_FRAMEWORK_GAPS.md` (lines 71-87)
- **Content**: Contains a code example suggesting VPC configuration
- **Limitation**: This was my own document, not official AWS documentation

## What Should Be Verified

### AWS CDK OpenSearch Domain API Reference
I should verify the actual CDK TypeScript API for `aws-opensearchservice.Domain`:

1. **CDK API Reference** (should check):
   - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_opensearchservice.Domain.html
   - Verify: `vpc`, `vpcSubnets`, `securityGroups` properties exist and are correct

2. **CDK Source Code** (TypeScript definitions):
   - Check `aws-cdk-lib/aws-opensearchservice/lib/domain.d.ts`
   - Verify property types and requirements

## Verification Status

### ✅ CDK Synthesis Success
- `npx cdk synth` completed without errors
- CloudFormation template generated with `VPCOptions` section
- This is a strong indicator that the properties are valid

### ✅ TypeScript Definitions Verified
- Checked `node_modules/aws-cdk-lib/aws-opensearchservice/lib/domain.d.ts`
- **VERIFIED**: `vpc?: ec2.IVpc` property exists (line ~200)
- **VERIFIED**: `securityGroups?: ec2.ISecurityGroup[]` property exists
- **VERIFIED**: `vpcSubnets?: ec2.SubnetSelection[]` property exists
- All properties match the TypeScript API definitions exactly

### ❌ Missing Initial API Documentation Reference
- I did not initially look up the CDK API reference
- I should have verified each property against the official CDK documentation
- **NOW FIXED**: Verified against actual TypeScript definitions

## Implementation Details

### Properties Used
```typescript
const opensearchDomain = new opensearch.Domain(this, "SearchDomain", {
  // ... other properties
  vpc: vpc,                                    // Type: IVpc
  vpcSubnets: [{ subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS }],  // Type: SubnetSelection[]
  securityGroups: [opensearchSecurityGroup],  // Type: ISecurityGroup[]
});
```

### CloudFormation Generated
The CDK synth generates:
```json
"VPCOptions": {
  "SecurityGroupIds": [...],
  "SubnetIds": [...]
}
```

This matches the AWS CloudFormation `AWS::OpenSearchService::Domain` resource structure.

## Verification Complete ✅

### TypeScript Definitions (Verified)
From `node_modules/aws-cdk-lib/aws-opensearchservice/lib/domain.d.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * @see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/vpc.html
 * @default - Domain is not placed in a VPC.
 */
readonly vpc?: ec2.IVpc;

/**
 * The list of security groups that are associated with the VPC endpoints
 * for the domain.
 * Only used if `vpc` is specified.
 * @see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html
 * @default - One new security group is created.
 */
readonly securityGroups?: ec2.ISecurityGroup[];

/**
 * The specific vpc subnets the domain will be placed in. You must provide one subnet for each Availability Zone
 * that your domain uses.
 * Only used if `vpc` is specified.
 * @see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html
 * @default - All private subnets.
 */
readonly vpcSubnets?: ec2.SubnetSelection[];
```

### Implementation Status
- ✅ All three properties verified against TypeScript definitions
- ✅ CDK synthesis succeeds
- ✅ CloudFormation template generates correct `VPCOptions`
- ⚠️ Note: `vpcSubnets` default is "All private subnets" - my explicit filter may be redundant but is valid
