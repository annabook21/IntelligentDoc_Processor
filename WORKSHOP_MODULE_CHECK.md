# Workshop Module Verification

## Question
Did I reference module 05-idp-gen-ai from the AWS Intelligent Document Processing Workshop?

## Honest Answer
**No, I did not reference the specific module `05-idp-gen-ai`.**

I made general assumptions about what a "simplified AWS workshop pattern" would look like, but I did not:
1. Read the specific module content
2. Verify the architecture against module 05-idp-gen-ai
3. Check what Gen AI integration that module actually recommends

## What I Did Instead
1. Referenced the workshop in general terms: https://catalog.workshops.aws/intelligent-document-processing/en-US
2. Made assumptions that "simplified" = remove Bedrock Flows, OpenSearch, VPC
3. Created a basic Lambda → Textract → Comprehend → DynamoDB pattern
4. Did NOT verify if module 05-idp-gen-ai actually uses Bedrock models (which might be important)

## Potential Issue
Module 05-idp-gen-ai is specifically about **Generative AI** integration. This likely means:
- It probably DOES use Bedrock models (Claude, etc.)
- It might use Bedrock for summarization, insights, or structured extraction
- My simplified version removed Bedrock entirely, which may have removed something the workshop actually recommends

## What Should Be Done
1. **Read the actual module content** at: https://catalog.workshops.aws/intelligent-document-processing/en-US/05-idp-gen-ai
2. **Verify the architecture** against what module 05-idp-gen-ai actually recommends
3. **Adjust if needed** - if the module uses Bedrock for Gen AI features, we should include that
4. **Be honest about what was referenced** vs. what was assumed

## Current Status
- ❌ Did not read module 05-idp-gen-ai
- ❌ Did not verify architecture against specific module
- ✅ Did simplify (but may have oversimplified)
- ⚠️ May have removed important Gen AI components

## Next Steps
1. Review module 05-idp-gen-ai content
2. Check if Bedrock models are needed for the use case
3. Add Gen AI features if the workshop module recommends them
4. Update architecture to match actual workshop pattern
